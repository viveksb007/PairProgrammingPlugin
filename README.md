Pair Programming Plugin for IntelliJ Idea

## Parked dev work because IntelliJ already released CodeWithMe plugin :P

## Local Setup
- Create a temporary project with 2 txt files, so that **Test IDE** doesn't start building and indexing stuff.
- Clone this project
- Run **runIde** gradle task (it will open another IntelliJ instance for testing plugin)
